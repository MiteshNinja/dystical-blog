        <h1>How do I store and manage my 'data' / 'files'?</h1>
    </header>
    <p>In this day and age, taking and storing digital data especially <em>documents</em> is trivial. It's inevitable and everyone has to do it at some point or the other.</p>
<p>I like keeping things organized neatly and avoid storing unecessary files, books, documents, items and even redundant information. I hate storing my data locally; <em>Cloud</em> is the way to go, it makes the data easy to acess from any computer and keeps the working environment consistent and clutter free.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>To be able to do this, I need an application / software / method which is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sync</strong> - ability to sync across all my devices. That includes all my Linux OS, Windows OS and Android OS.</li>
<li><strong>Clean</strong> - void of unecessary distractions and options; <em>Clutter free</em> U.I</li>
<li><strong>Easy</strong> - Adding / removing / updating of data must be easy and intuitive.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong> - Editing / backups / upgrading / future-shifting must be easy to do.</li>
<li><strong>Indexed</strong> - what's the point of storing files if you can't access the contents at the right time?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Keeping the above points in mind, I chose the following services:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dropbox</strong>:</p>
<p>I was torn out between <a href="https://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> for my note taking requirements.
  Evernote provided tons of features including OCR, searchable files and tons of other features. But it had some major flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>It wasn't available on linux natively. Yes, the web app worked but it was slow and clunky.</li>
<li>Most of the things which made Evernote awesome was locked behind a paywall of $5 per month (cheaper in India ~â‚¹240 per month).</li>
<li><p>Even after trying out premium for a month, I wasn't satisfied because Evernote lacked Markdown support. I'm a huge fan of writing stuff in markdown. It's easy, future-proof and flexible. This was a huge factor for me to avoid Evernote.</p>
<p>Whereas Dropbox was available natively for Linux, Windows and Android, supported any type of files and was <strong>extremely flexible</strong> (specially when used with a shell/terminal). Thus, I decided to store all my notes in dropbox which then instantly got synced everywhere. Even though Dropbox has a limit (currently ~4.5 GB for me), it can be upgraded to 16GB worth of free space by referring friends or completing tasks, which I believe is <em>more than enough</em> for <strong>notes, files, documents and code</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Google Drive</strong>:</p>
<p>All the data apart from text will be stored in google drive. Since I have a couple of gmail accounts and google provides a total of 15 GB free space (for all their services), storing media and other heavy files should be no issue for the near future. If ever I do need more space, Drive provides 100 GB of extra space for only $1.99 per month which I believe is a better bang for buck when compared to Evernote Premium.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hard Drive</strong>:</p>
<p>For everthing else, i.e: old photos, family videos, phone backups and pretty much anything which is rarely used; I prefer a good ol' Western Digital 1 TB HDD. It's cheap, effective but risky. Which is why I have a backup of that data on other HDD's :D)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Recently <strong>Amazon Drive</strong> released a new plan of allowing to store unlimited data for only <strong>$59.99</strong>/<strong>YEAR</strong>, which I think is absolutely mind blowing. Let's see how it goes and how it affects pricing of it's competitors, especially Google and Dropbox.</p>
