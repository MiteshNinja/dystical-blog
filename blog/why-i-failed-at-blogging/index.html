        <h1>Why I failed at blogging.</h1>
    </header>
    <p>People write for several reasons. Fame, wealth, self-satisfaction, passion, entertainment, boredom, depression to name a few among others. But what do I write for? The answer isn't as easy as categorzing it into a single noun, rather it's very complicated. Complicated enough, that I can't quite grok it myself.</p>
<p>This is not my only blog. I have 4 more blogs, and a llog (local log). That is 6 [b]logs in total. My local log is basically a mixture of dear diary posts, list of things I like/dislike, all my keep notes, and anything and everything extremely personal which I want to keep private. There's also a blog which I recently launched (7th June, 2016). Launched without any content (and hence the realisation of this posts title). I will be ignoring these two [b]logs for the rest of the post.</p>
<p>That leaves us with 4.</p>
<p>Apart from those two there's a private blog, not nearly as personal as my llog, yet I have chosen to safely and securely lock behind a password. I've done this because I'm simply scared to dump my unadulterated thoughts out in the vast openness of the internet.</p>
<p>Then there were 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>miteshshah.com - My personal blog.<ul>
<li>This one exists mostly for self improvement, and as a place to store memories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>computableverse.com - My tech blog.<ul>
<li>This one exists so that I can unburden all the inner geek messages out in the wild for other fellow lifeforms to intercept.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>anonymous - My anonymous blog.<ul>
<li>Ah this one has a really special reason. I already have a llog and a personl private blog. So one might ask, what use could be an anonymous blog? Nothing for me really. It's for others. It's for the kind of messages, thoughts, and learning I believe others can absorb value from, but I don't feel comfortable in attaching my identity to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've launched these 4 blogs at different times since 2015. But I've only managed to churn out 20 posts in total. That's way too low, specially because the quality isn't top notch either.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder, have I <em>failed as a blogger</em>?</p>
<p>But that inturn makes me wonder, is failing bad? Is it something to be afraid of? Does it mean the end? <strong>HELL NO!</strong>.</p>
<p>James Dyson, inventor of the cyclonic vaccum cleaner, eqloquently conveys a message <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/59549/failure-doesnt-suck">about failure</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure I've made mistakes. I've learnt from them. It doesn't matter if I've been focusing on the <em>wrong</em> things up until now. Because I've learnt that there are only two things I need for my next attempt. <strong>Ruthless focus</strong> and a <strong>well defined dream</strong>.</p>
