    <blockquote><p>Writing is an exploration. You start from nothing and learn as you go.<br>
<cite><small>E. L. Doctorow</small></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's been over 40 days since I last posted here. When I go back and read some of the things I have written in the past, I can truly
understand the difference between the <em>then me</em> and <em>now me</em>. We change a little everyday, we should accept and embrace that.</p>
<p>I still love writing though and I have been writing a lot.. but I am unable to finish them. I'm always confused as to what topic needs
an individual post and what ideas should be clubbed into one. This happens. I know. But regardless of whether what I write is 'perfectly structured'
or if it is completely chaotic, I must write because after all something <strong>is</strong> better than nothing.</p>
<p>Writing things online where anyone in the world can read holds you accountable of the things you do, of the things you write.
It gives one a sense of duty, even if no one reads. This is what also helps in self-improvement.</p>
<p>But because this blog is purely for pleasure and self-improvement, doesn't mean I push out unpolished post. If I keep doing that, how will I improve?</p>
<p>I must simply put in my 100% when writing, doesn't matter if the post comes out good, bad, muddled, or decent.</p>
<p>I truly want to be a write 'something' worth reading, but as we know.. Sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something.</p>
